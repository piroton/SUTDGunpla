## Who We Are

SUTD Gunpla Club is a club of dedicated plastic model builders. Whether it be planes, boats, Gundam plastic models, Frame-Arms-Girls, etc... We welcome you all to join us if you have a love for plastic models and a desire to do more!

## What We Do

SUTD Gunpla works yearly on several major projects, besides our members' own plastic models. We've been participating yearly as exhibitors at Makerfaire / Makers Extravaganza, so you might have seen our work there.

### Large-Scale Model Building

Gunpla holds club-wide activities on an ad-hoc basis - All members are welcome to pitch new ideas for a large project, regardless of seniority. Be warned, though: If you pitch an idea and people are willing, you'll need to follow it through, hell or high water.

Check out some of our previous work!

### Commission Work

Besides large-scale models, Gunpla Club takes on commissioned work from the school, usually for highly-visible displays. We've worked on both the X18 scale model for the launch of SUTD Academy and the centrepiece for the 10th Anniversary celebrations, the light-up tree model mounted on top of the Momo robot.

[PICS SOON, I PROMISE]

We also tinker... a lot. Come swing by and see how we print and manufacture things to improve the little things in our lives!
